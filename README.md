## 📖 About The Project

In many educational institutions, the connection between current students and alumni is often lost after graduation. **ConnectLink** solves this by creating a centralized platform where:

* **Students** can seek guidance and mentorship.
* **Alumni** can share opportunities and achievements.
* **Teachers** can facilitate better communication.

This platform fosters a strong professional community, making networking accessible and verified within the college ecosystem.
